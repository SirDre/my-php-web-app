my-php-web-app
==============

A PHP web app that works with a mysql database.

What it does
==============
Retrieve and display the contents of the database relative to each other (eg, if the ‘Customer’ display is selected, I should be able to view the orders that each customer made).

Add records to the database (eg. Add an order for a pre-existing customer or add a new customer).

Sort the database by whichever criteria is selected (First Name, Last Name, Total amount of money spent).

Export records to a spreadsheet. (this is optional, but recommended).

Format the web page and the app to be aesthetically pleasing using CSS.
